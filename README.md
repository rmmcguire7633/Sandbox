abstract classes 
Classes that can't be used to create objects

abstract methods
Methods that have a header but no definition

the final keyword
final is used with variables to make them non-changable (constants)
final can be used with objects to make them reference final variables

final is used with methods to make them non-overridable

local class 
typically defined in the body of a method

nested class 
a class within another class

Nested classes that are declared static are called static nested classes. 
Non-static nested classes are called inner classes.
